packet.extend_from_slice(&ethernet_header);
packet.extend_from_slice(&ip_header);
packet.extend_from_slice(&udp_header);
packet.extend_from_slice(&payload);

        PacketType::Tcp => "TCP".to_string(),
        // ...
    }
}

// After: Interned strings with reference counting
fn get_protocol_name(packet_type: PacketType) -> InternedString {
    match packet_type {
        PacketType::Udp => protocols::udp(), // Reuses existing Arc<str>

}
```

### Memory Pool Integration
