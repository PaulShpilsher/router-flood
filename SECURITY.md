# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

Router Flood is designed with security as a fundamental principle. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting process, and security features.

## üîí Security Features

### Capability-Based Security

Router Flood uses Linux capabilities instead of requiring full root privileges:

- **CAP_NET_RAW**: Required for raw socket operations
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only requests necessary capabilities
- **Automatic Detection**: Runtime capability detection and validation
- **Graceful Degradation**: Dry-run mode works without any privileges
- **Security Context Analysis**: Comprehensive privilege and capability reporting
- **Runtime Validation**: Continuous security context monitoring

### Built-in Safety Mechanisms

1. **Private IP Validation**: Hard-coded restriction to RFC 1918 private ranges
   - 192.168.0.0/16
   - 10.0.0.0/8
   - 172.16.0.0/12

2. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in safety limits prevent system overwhelm
   - Maximum 100 threads
   - Maximum 10,000 packets per second per thread
   - Configurable safety thresholds

3. **Audit Logging**: Tamper-proof cryptographic audit trails
   - SHA-256 hash chains
   - Session tracking with UUIDs
   - Integrity verification

4. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs
   - Configuration file validation
   - CLI argument sanitization
   - Network parameter bounds checking

## üö® Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to security@router-flood.org
2. **Encrypt**: Use our PGP key (ID: 0x1234567890ABCDEF)
3. **Include**: 
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested mitigation (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Within 7 days for critical issues
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, privilege escalation | 24 hours |
| **High** | Information disclosure, DoS attacks | 72 hours |
| **Medium** | Local privilege escalation, input validation | 7 days |
| **Low** | Information leakage, minor security issues | 14 days |

## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Use Capabilities**: Avoid running as root
   ```bash
   sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep ./router-flood
   ./router-flood run --target 192.168.1.1  # Run as regular user
   ```

2. **Validate Configurations**: Always validate before running
   ```bash
   router-flood config validate my_config.yaml
   ```

3. **Use Dry-Run Mode**: Test configurations safely
   ```bash
   router-flood run --config test.yaml --dry-run
   ```

4. **Monitor System Resources**: Watch for unusual behavior
   ```bash
   router-flood system info
   router-flood system security
   ```

5. **Keep Updated**: Regularly update to latest version
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   cargo build --release
   ```

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Validate all external inputs
2. **Error Handling**: Use proper error handling, avoid panics
3. **Memory Safety**: Leverage Rust's memory safety guarantees
4. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated
5. **Code Review**: All changes require review
6. **Testing**: Maintain comprehensive test coverage

## üß™ Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing

1. **Property-Based Testing**: Validates behavior with random inputs
2. **Fuzzing**: Continuous fuzzing with cargo-fuzz
3. **Static Analysis**: Clippy linting with security-focused rules
4. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability scans

### Manual Security Testing

1. **Capability Testing**: Verify privilege requirements
2. **Input Validation**: Test with malformed inputs
3. **Network Security**: Validate IP range restrictions
4. **Audit Log Integrity**: Verify tamper detection

### Security Test Commands

```bash
# Run security-focused tests
cargo test security

# Run fuzzing tests
cargo fuzz run fuzz_packet_builder
cargo fuzz run fuzz_config_parser
cargo fuzz run fuzz_cli_parser

# Check for security vulnerabilities in dependencies
cargo audit

# Run with security-focused clippy lints
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Run property-based security tests
cargo test --test property_tests

# Comprehensive security validation
router-flood system security
```
