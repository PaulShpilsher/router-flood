```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.70+**: [Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Linux System**: Required for raw socket capabilities (kernel 3.10+)
- **Network Access**: Private network for testing
- **Memory**: Minimum 512MB RAM (2GB+ recommended for high-throughput testing)
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor recommended for optimal performance

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/paulspilsher/router-flood.git
cd router-flood

# Build with optimizations
cargo build --release

# Set capabilities (recommended over running as root)
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep ./target/release/router-flood
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Safe test with dry-run (no packets sent)
./target/release/router-flood --target 192.168.1.1 --ports 80,443 --dry-run

# Test with specific parameters
./target/release/router-flood --target 192.168.1.1 --ports 80 --threads 4 --rate 500 --duration 30

# Using configuration file
./target/release/router-flood --config config.yaml
```

## üì¶ Architecture Overview

### Core Components

#### **Worker** (src/network/worker.rs)
- Single packet processing with rate limiting
- Pre-allocated buffers for zero-copy operations
- Pre-calculated packet type distribution based on protocol mix
- Local statistics batching (50 packets) before atomic flush

#### **Stats** (src/stats/stats_aggregator.rs)
- Simple atomic counters (AtomicU64) for lock-free operation
- BatchStats for worker-local accumulation
- Automatic flush on batch size threshold
- Export support for JSON/CSV formats

#### **MemoryPool** (src/performance/memory_pool.rs)
- Lock-free Treiber stack implementation
- Pre-allocated 64KB buffers
- Zero allocations after initialization
- Automatic buffer recycling via RAII guards

#### **SIMD** (src/performance/simd.rs)
- AVX2/SSE4.2 payload generation
- Runtime CPU feature detection
- Fallback to standard generation
- ~3-5x speedup for payload creation

### Performance Characteristics

| Component | Implementation | Performance Impact |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Payload Generation | SIMD (AVX2/SSE4.2) | 3-5x faster |
| Memory Management | Lock-free pool | Zero allocations |
| Statistics | Batched atomics | 50x reduction in atomic ops |
| RNG | Pre-computed batches | 40% less overhead |
| CPU Affinity | NUMA-aware pinning | 15-25% throughput gain |
| Packet Construction | Zero-copy buffers | 30% memory bandwidth saved |

## üîß Configuration

### Basic Configuration

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench

# Property-based testing
cargo test --test property_tests

# Performance verification
cargo test --test performance_verification
```

## üìä Performance Tuning

### Optimization Tips

1. **CPU Affinity**: Pin workers to specific cores
2. **Batch Size**: Adjust batch size for workload (default: 50)
3. **Buffer Pool**: Pre-allocate sufficient buffers
4. **Rate Control**: Use appropriate rate limits

### Benchmarking

```bash
# Run performance benchmarks
cargo bench --bench packet_generation
cargo bench --bench stats_collection
cargo bench --bench buffer_pool
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

### Safety Features

- **Private IP Validation**: Only RFC 1918 addresses allowed
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents accidental DoS
- **Audit Logging**: Tamper-proof activity logs
- **Capability-Based**: No root required

### Best Practices

1. Always test in controlled environments
2. Use dry-run mode for initial testing
3. Monitor system resources during tests
4. Keep audit logs for compliance

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Permission denied | Run `sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep ./target/release/router-flood` |
| Cannot open raw socket | Ensure you're on Linux with CAP_NET_RAW capability |
| High CPU usage | Reduce thread count or packet rate |
| Memory issues | Adjust buffer pool size in configuration |
| Target not reachable | Verify network connectivity and firewall rules |
