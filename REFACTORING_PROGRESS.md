# Refactoring Progress Report

## Phase 1: Completed âœ…
- Created feature branch `refactor-simplification`
- Documented current public API baseline
- Initial build time benchmark: ~6 seconds

## Phase 2: Dead Code Removal - Partially Complete ðŸ”„

### Completed:
1. **Removed monitoring module** - Entire directory deleted
2. **Removed unnecessary CLI modules**:
   - guided.rs (531 lines)
   - enhanced.rs
   - interactive.rs
   - prompts.rs
   - commands.rs
3. **Removed unnecessary performance files**:
   - string_interning.rs
   - tables.rs
   - inline_hints.rs
   - constants.rs
4. **Updated dependencies** - Removed from Cargo.toml:
   - warp
   - uuid (replaced with timestamp-based IDs)
   - sha2, hex (stubbed out for now)
   - once_cell (replaced with std::sync::OnceLock)
   - config
   - proptest

### Dependencies Kept (determined to be necessary):
- csv (for export functionality)
- termios (for terminal control)

## Current Issues:
1. **cli_runner.rs** - Heavily dependent on removed guided CLI, needs major refactoring
2. **security_runner.rs** - References removed monitoring module, needs refactoring

## Files Modified:
- src/lib.rs - Removed monitoring module reference
- src/cli/mod.rs - Simplified exports
- src/performance/mod.rs - Removed unnecessary exports
- src/performance/batch_pipeline.rs - Removed string interning
- src/stats/display.rs - Replaced once_cell with OnceLock
- src/security/capabilities.rs - Stubbed out SHA256 hashing
- src/stats/stats_aggregator.rs - Replaced UUID with timestamp

## Next Steps:
1. Fix compilation errors in cli_runner.rs and security_runner.rs
2. Continue with Phase 3: Module consolidation
3. Refactor performance module while preserving critical optimizations

## Metrics:
- Files removed: ~10
- Lines removed: ~2000+
- Dependencies removed: 8
- Build still failing due to cli_runner and security_runner issues
